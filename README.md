# Palindrome Checker

This is a part of my FreeCodeCamp [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). It's the first project in the module. The code passes all of the tests in the [project requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker).

## Usage
